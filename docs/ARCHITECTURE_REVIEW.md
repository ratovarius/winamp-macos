## Verdict

The codebase is a **well-engineered enthusiast project with several genuinely
sophisticated parts** — the concurrency model, the FFT→display frame-pacing, and the
"DSP-as-pure-functions" discipline are above the bar for hobby projects and some
commercial ones. It is **not yet best-in-class for a professional, extensible audio
player**, and the gaps cluster in exactly the four target areas. None of the gaps are
deep rewrites: the foundations are sound; what's missing is a small number of *seams*
and *infrastructure*.

| Goal | Grade | One-line summary |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Modular audio pipeline | **C+ → B** | **`AudioGraph` + `AudioEffectUnit` chain landed (P1 ✅)**; EQ, NowPlaying, AUTO-preamp, and remote commands extracted from the god object. Further transport decomposition is optional. |
| 2. Excellent + performant visualizations | **B+ → A−** | **P2 ✅**: all 11 presets now render distinctly (the `% 4` ceiling is gone), `VizUniforms` layout is assertion-guarded, and pipeline-compile failures are logged. Multi-pass plugin refactor (V1) deferred. |
| 3. Fully automated testability | **C+ → B−** | ~177 good unit tests exist; **CI now runs them (P0 ✅)**. Views/render/window still untested. |
| 4. Profiling (CPU/mem/GPU) | **C → B−** | **`os_signpost` + GPU timing added (P0 ✅)**. MetricKit + memory instrumentation still open. |

## Goal 1 — Modularity of the audio pipeline  ✅ (P1 complete)

> **Progress (2026-06-16, P1):** the hardcoded wiring below has been replaced by an
> [`AudioGraph`](../Sources/Audio/AudioGraph.swift) that connects an ordered list of
> [`AudioEffectUnit`](../Sources/Audio/AudioEffectUnit.swift)s
> (`source → effects → mainMixer`), with the EQ extracted as the first unit
> ([`EQAudioEffect`](../Sources/Audio/EQAudioEffect.swift)). Adding a DSP module is now
> `graph.insert(_:at:)` / `graph.append(_:)` — no hand-wiring. The EQ DSP *policy*
> (flat/disabled passthrough, dB→linear preamp, AUTO preamp compensation) moved into
> `EQAudioEffect`, the lock-screen mapping into
> [`NowPlayingInfo`](../Sources/NowPlayingInfo.swift), and media-key routing into
> [`RemoteCommandController`](../Sources/RemoteCommandController.swift) — each unit tested
> in isolation. **Intentionally left inline:** the transport methods
> (`play`/`pause`/`seek`), which are tightly coupled to the serial `audioQueue` +
> generation-ID race protection and are already covered by real-engine integration tests.
> The `AudioRenderingEngine` mock-engine seam was **deliberately deferred**: the
> `testing_*` hooks it would remove currently assert *real* engine behavior (auto-advance,
> transport actions, node reuse), so replacing them with a mock would lower test fidelity
> for little gain. The original analysis below stands as the historical baseline.

**The biggest architectural gap relative to the stated goal** ("possibility to add audio
modules to the pipeline").

The graph is built once, imperatively, hand-wired in
[`AudioPlayer.setupAudioEngine()`](../Sources/AudioPlayer.swift#L139-L170):

```
player → preamp → eq → mainMixer        (+ FFT tap on mainMixer)
```

To add a module (compressor, limiter, crossfeed/headphone DSP, resampler, a second EQ,
a VST-like effect), today you must:

1. Add another `nonisolated(unsafe) var someNode: AVAudioUnit?` field
   ([`AudioPlayer.swift#L60-L66`](../Sources/AudioPlayer.swift#L60-L66)),
2. Edit `setupAudioEngine()` to `attach` + re-`connect` the chain,
3. Thread its parameters/state through the god object by hand.

There is **no `AudioEffect`/`AudioNode` protocol**, no ordered insertable chain, no
per-effect bypass / wet-dry contract. The EQ is hardwired as a concrete
`AVAudioUnitEQ`; ReplayGain is applied as `playerNode.volume` rather than as a node; the
analysis tap is hardwired onto `mainMixerNode` inside the player.

Compounding this, [`AudioPlayer.swift`](../Sources/AudioPlayer.swift) is a **996-line god
object** owning transport, engine lifecycle, EQ, ReplayGain/volume,
`MPRemoteCommandCenter`, now-playing info, the spectrum tap, the 10 Hz UI
timer, *and* ~10 `testing_` hooks. The "pipeline" is inseparable from transport and UI.

**Best-in-class target:** an `AudioGraph` that owns the `AVAudioEngine` and exposes an
ordered list of `AudioEffectUnit`. EQ becomes *one* unit; new modules implement the
protocol and are inserted without touching transport.

```swift
protocol AudioEffectUnit: AnyObject {
    var node: AVAudioNode { get }
    var isBypassed: Bool { get set }
    func attach(to engine: AVAudioEngine)
}

final class AudioGraph {
    func insert(_ unit: AudioEffectUnit, at index: Int)   // rewires neighbors
    func remove(_ unit: AudioEffectUnit)
    var tapPoint: AVAudioNode { get }                     // where the FFT tap lives
}
```

**Already good here (preserve):** the AVAudioEngine setup is clean; the bit-perfect
passthrough/bypass logic
([`applyEQSettings`](../Sources/AudioPlayer.swift#L222-L240)) is thoughtful; and the
**generation-ID race protection** (`loadGeneration` / `playbackGeneration`) for stale
loads/seeks is genuinely professional-grade.

## Goal 2 — Visualizations (looks + performance)  🟡

**The strongest area.** The performance engineering is real:

- Metal via `MTKView` delegate (vsync-aligned), **triple buffering** (`FrameBufferRing`)
  + `DispatchSemaphore(3)` GPU back-pressure
  ([`MetalVisualizationPlugin.swift#L34-L48`](../Sources/Visualization/MetalVisualizationPlugin.swift#L34-L48)).
- **Idle gating** to pause the render loop and save power when audio stops
  ([`VisualizerIdleGate.swift`](../Sources/Visualization/VisualizerIdleGate.swift)).
- **Frame pacing** solving the macOS "tap fires ~10 Hz but display is 60–120 Hz"
  mismatch by storing every FFT hop and playing them out by elapsed time
  ([`VisualizationPlayoutClock.swift`](../Sources/Visualization/VisualizationPlayoutClock.swift),
  documented in [`VISUALIZER_PERFORMANCE.md`](VISUALIZER_PERFORMANCE.md)). Most
  implementations get this wrong.
- Pure, unit-tested smoother + peak-tracker; pipeline-state caching behind an unfair lock.
- A real plugin seam exists:
  [`MetalVisualizationPlugin`](../Sources/Visualization/MetalVisualizationPlugin.swift#L22-L31).

**Where it falls short of "best-in-class extensible visuals":**

| # | Issue | Severity | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | Multi-pass persistence/composite orchestration lives in the **renderer**, not behind the plugin protocol — a new visualization needing different passes requires engine surgery. | 🟡 Medium · **deferred** | [`MetalVisualizationView.swift`](../Sources/Visualization/MetalVisualizationView.swift) `drawSpectrumWithPeakPersistence` |
| V2 | Fullscreen presets aliased via `preset % 4` — only 4 of 11 reachable, names mislabeled. | ✅ **Fixed (P2)** | now a total one-branch-per-preset dispatch in [`VisualizerShaders.metal`](../Sources/Shaders/VisualizerShaders.metal); 11 distinct effects |
| V3 | `VizUniforms` duplicated in Swift + Metal with no layout check. | ✅ **Fixed (P2)** | Metal `static_assert` on size/alignment + [`VizUniformsLayoutTests`](../Tests/WinampTests/VizUniformsLayoutTests.swift) on stride/offsets |
| V4 | Silent pipeline-compile failures (`try? … → nil`, no log). | ✅ **Fixed (P2)** | [`MetalVisualizationEngine.makePipeline`](../Sources/Visualization/MetalVisualizationEngine.swift) logs missing functions + compile errors via `os.Logger` |
| V5 | Minor per-frame allocations on the render path (waveform `readResampled`, uniforms struct). | 🟢 Low | `WaveformRingBuffer`, `MetalPipelineProvider.updateFloatBuffer` |

**V2 design.** Each `VisualizationPreset` case maps 1:1 to a named shader branch dispatched
by `rawValue` with **no wraparound**; `VisualizationPreset.shaderBranchCount` +
`VisualizationPresetTests` guard the Swift↔shader contract so adding a preset that lacks a
shader branch fails a test. Adding a visualization is now: add an enum case + a shader
branch. **V1** (multi-pass orchestration behind the plugin protocol) was deferred: it
reworks correct, working render code for extensibility not yet needed — the same
risk/value judgement applied to transport extraction in P1.

---

## Goal 3 — Fully automated testability  🟡 (CI gap closed in P0)

**The unit-test foundation is good; the *automation* was the broken part.**

- ~177 tests across 38 files thoroughly cover the *pure* layers: FFT, auto-leveler, peak
  tracker, playout clock, ring buffer, parsers (M3U/metadata/EQF), playlist
  manager/state/bookmarks, volume model, EQ bands, window snapping/docking. A genuinely
  strong base reflecting deliberate "extract pure function → test it" discipline.
- Good DI seams exist:
  [`AudioPlaybackControlling`](../Sources/AudioPlaybackControlling.swift) +
  [`MockAudioPlayer`](../Tests/WinampTests/MockAudioPlayer.swift), plus injectable
  `featureBus`, `engine`, and `VisualizationClock`.

**Was-critical, now fixed (P0 ✅):** CI did **not** run the tests —
[`.github/workflows/build.yml`](../.github/workflows/build.yml) only built the app, made
a DMG, and cut a release. The suite only ran when someone remembered to run it locally.
A `test` job now runs `scripts/run-tests.sh`, and `build` has `needs: test`, so failing
tests block the release.

**Remaining testability debt:**

| # | Issue | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | `AudioPlayer` carries **~10 `testing_` methods in the production type** ([`AudioPlayer.swift#L818-L905`](../Sources/AudioPlayer.swift#L818-L905)) — a symptom of the type being too coupled to mock cleanly. Extracting `AudioRenderingEngine` removes most. | 🟡 Medium |
| T2 | Untested: all SwiftUI views, the Metal `draw` loop, window-drag management, and the actual playback lifecycle (only state transitions are tested). | 🟡 Medium |
| T3 | Pervasive singletons (`AudioFeatureBus.shared`, etc.) carry state *between* tests, undermining isolation. | 🟢 Low |

---

## Goal 4 — Profiling (CPU / memory / GPU)  🟡 (signposts added in P0)

There's a real **measurement culture** here
([`VISUALIZER_PERFORMANCE.md`](VISUALIZER_PERFORMANCE.md) shows rigorous, measured
debugging) — the gap was that the **tooling was ad-hoc** (`print` + `sample`), not
Instruments-grade.

**Fixed in P0 ✅:** a centralized `os_signpost` layer
([`Instrumentation.swift`](../Sources/Utilities/Instrumentation.swift)) with `Audio` and
`Visualization` categories under subsystem `com.winamp.macos`:

- `frame` interval around per-frame CPU encoding in the renderer.
- `gpu` event emitting `gpuEndTime − gpuStartTime` (µs) from the command-buffer
  completion handler.
- `fftAnalyze` interval around per-buffer FFT work in the analyzer.

The retired `print`-based probes (`[DRAW-DIAG]`, `[EFF-DIAG]`, `[BAR-UPDATE]`,
`[TAP-DIAG]`, `[FRAMES-IN]`) and the now-dead `DiagnosticLog.swift` were removed. These
signposts cost ~nothing when no trace is recording and surface directly in Instruments.

**Remaining profiling debt:**

| # | Issue | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| P-A | **No MetricKit** subscriber (no field CPU/memory/hang/launch aggregation). | 🟡 Medium |
| P-B | **No memory instrumentation** — allocations-per-frame on the render path (V5) are not tracked. | 🟢 Low |
| P-C | `WinampMetrics` is a **misnomer** — it's UI layout constants, not performance metrics. Potential naming confusion. | 🟢 Low |

---

## Cross-cutting strengths (keep these)

- **Concurrency model is carefully reasoned**: a single serial `audioQueue` owns the
  engine, `@MainActor` isolates UI, generation IDs guard races, and `nonisolated(unsafe)`
  is used *deliberately under a single-queue discipline* rather than carelessly.
- **Clear module folders** (`Audio/`, `Visualization/`, `Playlist/`, `Views/`,
  `Utilities/`) with boundaries documented in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
- **Lock-protected feature bus** with a clean snapshot API
  ([`AudioFeatureBus.swift`](../Sources/Audio/AudioFeatureBus.swift)).

## Prioritized roadmap

### P0 — cheap, high-impact  ✅ Done (2026-06-16)

1. ✅ **Add a test job to CI** (`xcodebuild test` via `scripts/run-tests.sh`) gating the
   release. Unblocks goal 3's automation.
2. ✅ **`os_signpost` instrumentation layer + GPU command-buffer timing**; retired the
   `print`-based probes. Unblocks goal 4.

### P1 — the modularity foundation (goal 1)  ✅ Done (2026-06-16)

3. ✅ **Insertable effect chain.** `AudioGraph` + `AudioEffectUnit` with EQ as the first
   unit (`EQAudioEffect`), EQ policy unit-tested. The `AudioRenderingEngine` mock-engine
   seam was **deliberately deferred** — the `testing_*` hooks it would remove assert
   *real* engine behavior (auto-advance, transport, node reuse), so a mock would lower
   fidelity. Revisit only when a concrete need (e.g. gapless/crossfade) forces the
   boundary.
4. ✅ **Decompose `AudioPlayer`.** `NowPlayingInfo` (lock-screen mapping), the EQ
   AUTO-preamp math, and `RemoteCommandController` (media-key routing) extracted +
   unit-tested. Transport (`play`/`pause`/`seek`) intentionally left inline: it is
   threading-sensitive (serial `audioQueue` + generation IDs) and already covered by
   real-engine integration tests, so extracting it now is high-risk / low-value.

### P2 — visualization extensibility (goal 2)  🟡 In progress

5. 🟡 **Preset system + robustness.** ✅ Removed the `% 4` ceiling — all 11 presets render
   distinctly via a total dispatch (V2); ✅ `VizUniforms` layout assertion on both sides
   (V3); ✅ pipeline-compile failures logged (V4). ⬜ Multi-pass orchestration behind the
   plugin protocol (V1) deferred — reworks working render code for not-yet-needed
   extensibility.

5. **Move multi-pass orchestration behind the plugin protocol** (V1), add a
   **data-driven preset system** (fix the `% 4` ceiling, V2), add a **compile-time
   `VizUniforms` layout assertion** (V3) + **logging on pipeline-compile failure** (V4).

### P3 — testability depth (goal 3)  ⬜

6. Add **snapshot tests** for the retro chrome and a small **render-smoke harness** for
   the Metal path (T2); reduce singleton state-bleed between tests (T3).

### P4 — profiling depth (goal 4)  ⬜

7. Add a **MetricKit** subscriber (P-A) and optional allocation tracking on the render
   path (P-B).

| 2026-06-16 | P1 (foundation): introduced `AudioGraph` + `AudioEffectUnit`; extracted the EQ as `EQAudioEffect` (policy unit-tested); `AudioPlayer` now builds its pipeline from an ordered effect chain instead of hardcoded wiring. |
| 2026-06-16 | P1 (decomposition): extracted `NowPlayingInfo` (lock-screen mapping) and the EQ AUTO-preamp math into testable units; deferred the `AudioRenderingEngine` mock seam (would lower real-engine test fidelity). |
| 2026-06-16 | P1 (complete): extracted `RemoteCommandController` (media-key routing, unit-tested without the shared command center). Goal 1 met; transport left inline by design. |
| 2026-06-16 | P2 (most): all 11 fullscreen presets render distinctly (removed shader `% 4` ceiling, V2); `VizUniforms` Swift/Metal layout assertion (V3); pipeline-compile failures logged (V4). V1 (multi-pass behind plugin protocol) deferred. |
